Custom_Settings
===============

[Android] Custom settings layout with a header.

This uses a `listview` to contain everything from "settings.xml".

Implementation:
- Copy the xml files to your project (custom_preferences.xml, settings.xml)
- Copy the png files to your drawable folder (xxhdpi: "apps", "rate", "shareapp")

Done! Edit the settings.xml with preferences as usual and feel free to change the layout of the header by altering "custom_preferences.xml".
